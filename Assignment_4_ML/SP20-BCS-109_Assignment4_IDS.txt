            QUESTION 1
1)	Number of instances:	80
2)	Number of input attributes:	7
3)	Number of possible values of output attributes:	2
4)	There are four categorical input attributes, these are:
    a)	Beard
    b)	Hair length
    c)	Scarf
    d)	Eye color
5)	Class ratio of Male VS Female is:
    a)	Male:		46
    b)	Female:		34


            QUESTION 2
1)	In the RandomForestClassifier, no instances were incorrectly classified with an accuracy of 100%. When SVC was 
    used, 3 instances were incorrecly classified as true and 3 instances were incorrectly classified as false with
    an accuracy of 77.78%. When the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier was used, 1 instance was incorrectly classified
    as true and 2 instances were incorrecly classified as true with an accuracy of 88.89%.
    (The screenshots are there in the .pdf file in the same directory)

2)  Yes, changing the train/test split from 67/33 to 80/20 did bring some major changes. The RandomForestClassifier is
    giving the same 100% accuracy as before but the accuracy of SVC has increased from 77.78% to 81.25% as now only 2 
    instances were incorrecly classified as true and only 1 instance was incorrecly classified as false. Then, in case
    of the Multilayer Perceptron Classifier, no instances were incorrectly classified with an accuracy of 100%. 

3)  The two attributes i think that are the most "powerful" in the prediction task are Beard and Hair Length. Because these
    both combined can actually predict the result better than the other attributes whole together without them.

4)
